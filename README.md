# Master Thesis Python code 
###### By Luis Barrantes Coloma
 
This repository contains the Python code used to do the practical section of Luis Barrantes Coloma's Master Thesis.

### Overview
This Python code modifies and edits downloaded sun and wind data sets; merges them and does the decorrelation study for the selected sets. It also calculates the minimum storage system for that said set. 

More information about the code explanation is available in Luis Barrantes's Master Thesis: **DECORRELATION BETWEEN SOLAR AND WIND POWER AND ITS EFFECT ON ENERGY STORAGE DIMENSIONING**.

Some data sets have also been provided so the experimentation can be varried out. The .csv files must be in the same directory as the main program; for space and organization purposes they have been collected in a folder. More location data sets can be downloaded from [the solar radiation tool from PVGIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/es/#MR); the specific details for the downloaded data format can be found in the project's memory.
